# Data Jamboree

This is code presented at the [Data Jamboree](https://asa-ssc.github.io/minisymp2023/jamboree/) as part of the ASA Mini Symposium on [Statistical Computing in Action](https://asa-ssc.github.io/minisymp2023/) 

The code is in the file `jamboree_code.ipynb`.  The other notebook file (`jamboree_code_run.ipynb`) is exactly the same except it shows the output (although Plotly figures don't show up in the notebook).
